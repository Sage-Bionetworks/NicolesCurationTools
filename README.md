The goal of NicolesCurationTools is to facilitate data curation. For example,
this package will (eventually) create and upload a master table to Synapse for
the AMP-AD consortium. Currently, the focus for the master table is a complete
index of all specimenIDs and individualIDs for each study.

## Requirements

The package currently requires appropriate credentials for accessing the
AMP-AD data.

## Installation

You can install the development version of NicolesCurationTools with:

``` r
devtools::install_github("Sage-Bionetworks/NicolesCurationTools")
```
